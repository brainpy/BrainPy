    "In the previous section, we have learned that BrainPy offers `brainpy.math.array` that support common NumPy-like operations, which brings great convenience to users familiar with NumPy. NumPy-like operations, however, does not always apply to brain dynamics modeling. As one may recognize, the most costive computation in brain dynamics modeling lies in synaptic computation, as it involves the connection between two neuron groups. Two of the most salient features of synaptic computation are:\n",
    "1. **Sparse connection**: neuron-neuron connection in most brain regions is sparse.\n",
    "2. **Event-driven synaptic transmission**: synaptic transmission happens only when the presynaptic neurons fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we stick to array-related operations, there rise some problems making the computation extremely inefficient:\n",
    "1. Because of sparse connection, keeping using traditional array operations (e.g., matrix multiplication) will cause a huge waste in memory allocation and computation.\n",
    "2. Because of event-driven synaptic transmission, only a small proportion of presynaptic neurons are activated at a time, resulting in sparse transmission from pre- to post-synaptic neuron populations. Traditional array operations will compute the transmission based on the connection from all presynaptic neurons to their postsynaptic elements, unable to exclude those inactive neurons and to avoid redundant computation. \n",
