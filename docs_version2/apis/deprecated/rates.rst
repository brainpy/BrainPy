``brainpy.rates`` module
========================

.. currentmodule:: brainpy.rates 
.. automodule:: brainpy.rates 



``brainpy.rates`` module is deprecated and has been renamed as ``brainpy.dyn``. Although all models
can be accessed through ``brainpy.rates.xxx`` as old version of BrainPy, we recommend
users to use ``brainpy.dyn.xxx`` instead.


In general, from ``brainpy>=2.4.3``, we provide two modules:

- ``brainpy.dnn`` for modeling deep neural networks
- ``brainpy.dyn`` for modeling brain dynamics models
