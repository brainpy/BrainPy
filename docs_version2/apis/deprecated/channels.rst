``brainpy.channels`` module
===========================

.. currentmodule:: brainpy.channels 
.. automodule:: brainpy.channels 


``brainpy.channels`` module is deprecated has been renamed as ``brainpy.dnn``.
Although all models can be accessed through ``brainpy.channels.xxx`` as in old
version of BrainPy, we recommend users to use ``brainpy.dyn.xxx`` instead.

In general, from ``brainpy>=2.4.3``, we provide two modules:

- ``brainpy.dnn`` for modeling deep neural networks
- ``brainpy.dyn`` for modeling dynamics models
