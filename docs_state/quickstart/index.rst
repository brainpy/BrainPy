Quickstart
==========

Welcome to the quickstart guide for ``brainpy.state``! This section will help you get up and running
with the State-based programming paradigm for building and simulating spiking neural networks.

Whether you're new to BrainPy or transitioning from ``brainpy.dyn``, this guide provides everything
you need to start building neural models with the improved State-based approach.


What you'll learn
-----------------

This quickstart guide covers:

- **Installation**: How to install BrainPy with the appropriate backend (CPU, GPU, TPU) for your needs
- **5-Minute Tutorial**: A hands-on introduction to building your first neural network with ``brainpy.state``
- **Core Concepts**: Understanding the fundamental concepts of State-based programming and how it differs from traditional approaches


Getting started
---------------

If you're new to ``brainpy.state``, we recommend following these steps:

1. Start with :doc:`installation` to set up your environment
2. Follow the :doc:`5min-tutorial` to build your first model
3. Review :doc:`concepts-overview` to understand the underlying principles

For experienced users, you can jump directly to the concepts overview or explore the tutorials and examples sections.
