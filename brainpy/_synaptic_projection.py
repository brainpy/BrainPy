class SymmetryGapJunction(Projection):
    """
    Implements a symmetric electrical coupling (gap junction) between neuron populations.

    This class represents electrical synapses where the conductance is identical in both
    directions. Gap junctions allow bidirectional flow of electrical current directly between
    neurons, with the current magnitude proportional to the voltage difference between
    connected neurons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    couples : Union[Tuple[Dynamics, Dynamics], Dynamics]
        Either a single Dynamics object (when pre and post populations are the same)
        or a tuple of two Dynamics objects (pre, post) representing the coupled neuron populations.
    states : Union[str, Tuple[str, str]]
        Either a single string (when pre and post states are the same)
        or a tuple of two strings (pre_state, post_state) representing the state variables
        to use for calculating voltage differences (typically membrane potentials).
    conn : Callable
        Connection function that returns pre_ids and post_ids arrays defining connections.
    weight : Union[Callable, ArrayLike]
        Conductance weights for the gap junctions. The same weight applies in both directions
        of the connection.
    param_type : type, optional
        The parameter state type to use for weights, defaults to ParamState.

    Notes
    -----
    The symmetric gap junction applies identical conductance in both directions between
    connected neurons, ensuring balanced electrical coupling in the network.

    Calculate symmetrical electrical coupling through gap junctions between neurons.

    This function implements bidirectional gap junction coupling where the same weight is
    applied in both directions. It computes the electrical current flowing between
    connected neurons based on their potential differences and updates both pre-synaptic
    and post-synaptic neuron groups with appropriate input currents.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pre : Dynamics
        The pre-synaptic neuron group dynamics object.
    pre_value : ArrayLike
        State values (typically membrane potentials) of the pre-synaptic neurons.
    post : Dynamics
        The post-synaptic neuron group dynamics object.
    post_value : ArrayLike
        State values (typically membrane potentials) of the post-synaptic neurons.
    pre_ids : ArrayLike
        Indices of pre-synaptic neurons that form gap junctions.
    post_ids : ArrayLike
        Indices of post-synaptic neurons that form gap junctions,
        where each pre_ids[i] is connected to post_ids[i].
    weight : ArrayLike
        Conductance weights for the gap junctions. Can be a scalar (same weight for all connections)
        or an array with length matching pre_ids.

    Returns
    -------
    ArrayLike
        The input currents that were added to the pre-synaptic neuron group.

    Notes
    -----
    The electrical coupling is implemented as I = g(V_pre - V_post), where:
    - I is the current flowing from pre to post neuron
    - g is the gap junction conductance (weight)
    - V_pre and V_post are the membrane potentials of connected neurons

    Equal but opposite currents are applied to both connected neurons, ensuring
    conservation of current in the network.

    Raises
    ------

class AsymmetryGapJunction(Projection):
    """
    Implements an asymmetric electrical coupling (gap junction) between neuron populations.

    allow bidirectional flow of electrical current directly between neurons, with the current
    magnitude proportional to the voltage difference between connected neurons.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pre : Dynamics
        The pre-synaptic neuron group dynamics object.
    pre_state : str
        Name of the state variable in pre-synaptic neurons (typically membrane potential).

    conn : Callable
        Connection function that returns pre_ids and post_ids arrays defining connections.
    weight : Union[Callable, ArrayLike]
        Conductance weights for the gap junctions. Must have shape [..., 2] where the last
        dimension contains [pre_weight, post_weight] for each connection, defining
        potentially different conductances in each direction.
    param_type : type, optional
        The parameter state type to use for weights, defaults to ParamState.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import brainpy
    >>> import brainunit as u
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>>
    >>> # Create two neuron populations
    >>> n_neurons = 100
    >>> pre_pop = brainpy.LIF(n_neurons, V_rest=-70*u.mV, V_threshold=-50*u.mV)
    >>> post_pop = brainpy.LIF(n_neurons, V_rest=-70*u.mV, V_threshold=-50*u.mV)
    >>> pre_pop.init_state()
    >>> post_pop.init_state()
    >>>
    >>> # Create asymmetric gap junction with different weights in each direction
    >>> weights = np.ones((n_neurons, 2)) * u.nS
    >>> weights[:, 0] *= 2.0  # Double weight in pre->post direction
    >>>
    >>> gap_junction = brainpy.AsymmetryGapJunction(

    ...     conn=one_to_one,
    ...     weight=weights
    ... )

    Notes
    -----
    The asymmetric gap junction allows for different conductances in each direction between
    the same pair of neurons. This can model rectifying electrical synapses that preferentially
    allow current to flow in one direction.
