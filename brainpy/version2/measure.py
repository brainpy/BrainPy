    This method is adopted from Brian2.

    .. math::

        v_k = {n_k^{sp} \over T}

    Parameters::

    spikes : ndarray
      The spike matrix which record spiking activities.
    width : int, float
      The width of the ``window`` in millisecond.
    dt : float, optional
      The sample rate.
    numpy: bool
      Whether we use numpy array as the functional output.
      If ``False``, this function can be JIT compiled.

    Returns::

    rate : ndarray
        The population rate in Hz, smoothed with the given window.
