Key points for the operator customization:

1. `index` has two kinds of types: int32, int64
2. `data` has two kinds of types: float32, float64
3. `events` has three kinds of types: bool (True or False), float32, float64

    """Product of a sparse CSR matrix and a dense event vector.

    This function supports JAX transformations, including `jit()`, `grad()`,
    `vmap()` and `pmap()`.

    Parameters::

    data: ndarray, float
      An array of shape ``(nse,)``.
    indices: ndarray
      An array of shape ``(nse,)``.
    indptr: ndarray
      An array of shape ``(shape[0] + 1,)`` and dtype ``indices.dtype``.
    events: ndarray
      An array of shape ``(shape[0] if transpose else shape[1],)``
      and dtype ``data.dtype``.
    shape: tuple
      A length-2 tuple representing the matrix shape.
    transpose: bool
      A boolean specifying whether to transpose the sparse matrix
      before computing.
      If ``transpose=True``, the operator will compute based on the
      event-driven property of the ``events`` vector.

    Returns::

    y : Array
      The array of shape ``(shape[1] if transpose else shape[0],)`` representing
      the matrix vector product.
