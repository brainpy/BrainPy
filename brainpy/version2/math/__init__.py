"""
The ``math`` module for whole BrainPy ecosystem.
This module provides basic mathematical operations, including:

- numpy-like array operations
- linear algebra functions
- random sampling functions
- discrete fourier transform functions
- just-in-time compilation for class objects
- automatic differentiation for class objects
- dedicated operators for brain dynamics modeling
- activation functions
- device/dtype switching
- and others

Details in the following.

# necessity to wrap the jax.numpy.ndarray:
# 1. for parameters and variables which want to
#    modify in the JIT mode, this wrapper is necessary.
#    Because, directly change the value in the "self.xx"
#    cannot work.
# 2. In JAX, ndarray is immutable. This wrapper make
#    the index update is the same way with the numpy
