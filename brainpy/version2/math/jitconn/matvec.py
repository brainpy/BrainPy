    r"""Perform the :math:`y=M@v` operation,
    where :math:`M` is just-in-time randomly generated with a scalar `weight` at each position.

    This operator support ``jit()``, ``vmap()``, ``grad()`` and ``pmap()`` etc. transformations
    on CPU and GPU devices.

    .. warning::

       This API may change in the future.

    In this operation, :math:`M` is the random matrix with a connection probability
    `conn_prob`, and at each connection the value is the same scalar `weight`.

    When ``transpose=True``, we perform an operation of :math:`y=M^T@v`.

    .. note::

       Note that the just-in-time generated :math:`M` (`transpose=False`) is
       different from the generated :math:`M^T` (`transpose=True`).

       If you pursue the same :math:`M` and :math:`M^T` when performing the just-in-time
       matrix generation, you should set ``outdim_parallel=True``, with the sacrifice of
       the speed compared with ``outdim_parallel=False``.

    Parameters::

    vector: Array, ndarray
      The vector.
    weight: float
      The value of the random matrix.
    conn_prob: float
      The connection probability.
    shape: tuple of int
      The matrix shape.
    seed: int
      The random number generation seed.
    transpose: bool
      Transpose the random matrix or not.
    outdim_parallel: bool
      Perform the parallel random generations along the out dimension or not.
      It can be used to set the just-in-time generated :math:M^T: is the same
      as the just-in-time generated :math:`M` when ``transpose=True``.

    Returns::
