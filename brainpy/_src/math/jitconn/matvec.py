  This operator support ``jit()``, ``vmap()``, ``grad()`` and ``pmap()`` etc. transformations

  .. warning::

  In this operation, :math:`M` is the random matrix with a connection probability
  `conn_prob`, and at each connection the value is the same scalar `weight`.

  When ``transpose=True``, we perform an operation of :math:`y=M^T@v`.

  .. note::

     Note that the just-in-time generated :math:`M` (`transpose=False`) is
     different from the generated :math:`M^T` (`transpose=True`).

     If you pursue the same :math:`M` and :math:`M^T` when performing the just-in-time
     matrix generation, you should set ``outdim_parallel=True``, with the sacrifice of
     the speed compared with ``outdim_parallel=False``.

  Parameters
  ----------
  vector: Array, ndarray
    The vector.
  weight: float
    The value of the random matrix.
  conn_prob: float
    The connection probability.
  shape: tuple of int
    The matrix shape.
  seed: int
    The random number generation seed.
  transpose: bool
    Transpose the random matrix or not.
  outdim_parallel: bool
    Perform the parallel random generations along the out dimension or not.
    It can be used to set the just-in-time generated :math:M^T: is the same
    as the just-in-time generated :math:`M` when ``transpose=True``.

  Returns
  -------
  out: Array, ndarray
    The output of :math:`y = M @ v`.
